Infonite expandabke dropdown menus in jquery, javascriot, html 3 and css 2

I don't know abouther these licenses currently.  I believe the Wordpress license is open source.  My company has the copyright on the infinite expandable drop down menu, but there was a bug.

The corrected version should be contained within.

Terms of use: I must be provided with version upgrades, i.e., css 3, html 4, as well as, enhancements, such as, functional, not to include stylistic.
